# Report-on-Flood-Analysis-and-Forecast-for-Lagos
### Introduction
Unlike sudden natural disasters such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, flooding is a recurring event that has notably impacted Lagos, Nigeria. The most recent incident occurred on July 3rd, 2024, a day marked by torrential rains that inundated major roads and streets, from the island to the mainland. The flood's impact was so significant that it sparked widespread discussions on social media, particularly with the trending phrase “Dear HR.” While this may seem humorous, it highlights the severe disruptions and losses experienced by Lagos residents, including fatalities, building collapses, and extensive business interruptions.
The pressing question arises: Could these tragic events have been anticipated and possibly avoided? To address this, the HNG data analyst interns undertook the challenge of predicting future floods in Lagos. Despite the difficulty of obtaining relevant data and the high cost of available sources, this task aimed to forecast potential flood events.
This report outlines the methodology used to predict future flooding in Lagos. It details the process of acquiring, cleaning, and analyzing historical precipitation data, as well as the development and application of forecasting models. The approach was informed by comprehensive research, including works by Nura Umar & Alison Gray, Olumuyiwa Bayode Adegun, and Cynthia Ezinnem Atufu, who provided valuable insights into weather patterns and flood determinants.
### Data and Methodology
#### Data Collection
Source: The primary data used in this analysis consists of historical precipitation records for Lagos, Nigeria. This dataset spans from the year 2002 to 2024, providing a comprehensive view of precipitation patterns over the past two decades.
File: The data is stored in a CSV file named “lagos_weather_data_2002_to_2024.csv.”
#### Data Preparation
a. Data Loading: The CSV file was loaded into a pandas DataFrame to facilitate data manipulation and analysis.
b. Data Cleaning:
Whitespace Removal: Column names were stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace to ensure consistency.
Date Conversion: The 'Date' column was converted to datetime format to facilitate time series analysis and plotting.
Missing Values: Rows with missing values in the 'Date' column were removed to ensure the integrity of the dataset.
Indexing: The 'Date' column was set as the index of the DataFrame for easier time series operations.
Duplicates: Duplicate entries were removed to avoid redundancy and ensure accurate analysis.
#### Data Exploration:
Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation were computed to understand the distribution of precipitation.
Visualization: Historical precipitation trends were visualized using line plots to identify patterns and anomalies.

### Methodology
a. Data Splitting: The dataset was divided into training and test sets to evaluate the performance of the predictive model. An 80/20 split was used, where 80% of the data was used for training the model, and 20% was reserved for testing.
### Discussion
Overview of Results
The analysis aimed to forecast precipitation levels in Lagos and assess the risk of flooding for the near future. After employing an ARIMA model for time series forecasting, the resulting forecast indicated that there are no predicted instances of flooding within the forecast period.
#### Interpretation of Results
1. Model Performance and Accuracy: The ARIMA model used in this analysis is known for its effectiveness in capturing time series patterns and making short-term forecasts. The absence of predicted flood events in the forecast period suggests that the model did not anticipate precipitation levels exceeding the flood risk threshold during this time. This could indicate that, according to historical patterns and current predictions, the likelihood of extreme rainfall events sufficient to cause flooding is low for the next 30 days.
2. Data Quality and Model Limitations: Several factors could contribute to the outcome:
Data Quality: The historical data used spans from 2002 to 2024 and was thoroughly cleaned and preprocessed. However, data quality issues such as incomplete records or anomalies could impact model accuracy.
Model Limitations: ARIMA models assume linear relationships and may not capture non-linear patterns or sudden shifts in weather patterns. If the recent or upcoming weather patterns exhibit non-linear characteristics or abrupt changes not accounted for in the historical data, the ARIMA model might not detect these effectively.
3. Threshold Selection: The threshold for flood risk was set at 100 millimeters of precipitation. While this is a reasonable threshold for many flood risk assessments, local conditions, historical flood data, and expert opinions might suggest different thresholds. It is crucial to validate this threshold with historical flood events and local flood risk guidelines to ensure its appropriateness.
4. Forecast Horizon: The forecast was made for the next 30 days, which is a standard practice for short-term forecasting. However, extreme weather events can sometimes occur outside the typical forecast horizon. Continuous monitoring and updating forecasts with the latest data are recommended for a more accurate and responsive flood risk assessment.
5. External Factors: External factors such as changes in land use, urbanization, or climate change could influence precipitation patterns and flood risks. The model's historical data might not fully capture these factors if they have introduced significant changes in recent years.
6. Implications for Flood Risk Management: While no flood events were predicted for the forecast period, it is essential for flood risk management and planning to consider:
Long-Term Trends: Even if short-term forecasts do not indicate flooding, analyzing long-term trends in precipitation and flooding patterns is crucial for comprehensive flood risk management.
Emergency Preparedness: Maintaining a state of readiness and resilience for unexpected events remains critical, as weather patterns can be unpredictable.
7. Future Research Directions: To enhance forecasting accuracy and flood risk prediction, future research could include:
Incorporating Additional Data: Including other variables such as temperature, wind patterns, and soil moisture could provide a more comprehensive model.
Exploring Advanced Models: Leveraging more complex models, such as machine learning algorithms or ensemble methods, could potentially improve predictive performance.
Localized Thresholds: Assessing and calibrating flood risk thresholds based on localized historical flood data and expert knowledge.
### Conclusion
The forecasting analysis conducted using historical precipitation data for Lagos indicated that no flooding is predicted in the upcoming forecast period. This outcome suggests that, based on the ARIMA model's projections, precipitation levels are not expected to exceed the established threshold for flood risk in the near future.
Key Takeaways:
Forecasting Insight:
Model Effectiveness:
Importance of Continuous Monitoring:

### Implications:
The result of no predicted flooding is a positive sign for the immediate term but does not negate the need for ongoing preparedness and risk management. Flood risk is a dynamic factor influenced by various environmental and climatic conditions, and proactive measures remain crucial. Continued vigilance, preparedness, and refinement of predictive models will contribute to effective flood risk mitigation and management.
